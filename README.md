# Kurdish Sbtitles Application

>A mobile application translates video subtitles (captions) from other languges into Kurdish

This project is the mobile version of the [kurdish-subtitles](https://github.com/BDXBB/kurdish-subtitles) repository

---

I think i shoud use webview in mobile application but the challenge is rewrite the code that extracts & get the captions in dart or i can just use [content.js](https://github.com/BDXBB/kurdish-subtitles/blob/main/src/content.js) and dart use webview lib to load the js code 
However also we have challenge here wich is control the translate language & font & other settings ...

So i have to find or build Something like bridge between js and dart to communication between the two
